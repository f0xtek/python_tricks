# Python Tricks

My notes & practice code examples from the [Python Tricks](https://realpython.com/products/python-tricks-book/) book.

Code examples are broken down into their relevant chapters, some example practiced as they appear in the book, others are custom to further solidify concepts. Comments and docstrings serve as notes for each topic.

```
pipenv install
pipenv run <chapter folder>/<filename>.py
```
